export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a data enthusiast with a passion for exploring data, uncovering meaningful insights, and driving company growth. I am eager to pursue roles such as data analyst, machine learning engineer, and data engineer. This passion has inspired me to dive into learning Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Along the way, I've developed a strong foundation in machine learning, R, SQL, Tableu, and Excel for data analysis. I am always excited to work on data-related projects, and I've already completed several mini-projects in machine learning..`;
